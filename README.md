## Note:

Stylesheet is a file inside ```src/client/styles```
This is not minified css version !!!
and,

The sample code is not my code, its just that i found it cool that this code is projecting a cube from four direction like i used to do in engineering drawing in undergrad so i found it cool as a test code !!

I will write a sample code for hierarchial 3D object as a test code in few days and remove this !!

If you want to check it you can always go to commit history !!!
